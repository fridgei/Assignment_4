Assignment 4 - Part 2

For this assignment we developed an algorithm for joining multiple relations.
We use a hash database to index the largest relation which we determine at run
time. We create a generic entry object that can take a join attribute. The large
relation is indexed on the join attribute. The other relations to be joined are
sorted at run time to improve the performance of the join between it and the
intermediate relation. Our custom iterator determines whether it is operating
on an indexed relation which makes our solution extremely generic.
